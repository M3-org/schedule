[9:24 PM] BOTKoolala: vs. Minecraft
[9:25 PM] BOTpravvy: Epic is very interested in funding these type of projects. They just gave a big grant to Blender as well.
[9:25 PM] BOTKoolala: Social Networking... forever
[9:26 PM] BOTpravvy: I think it's a community service / PR thing, not just profit motive for Epic
[9:26 PM] kentbye: Fortnite enabled cross-play across 7 platforms, and so Sweeney's point is that Epic started to look at all sorts of open standards that are essentially leading us to the metaverse. He sees that the future of the immersive web browser is going to look a lot more like a game engine.

[9:31 PM] kentbye: I don't think Sweeney was necessarily arguing that Epic was going to be creating the Metaverse with Unreal or Fortnite. There's lots of nuance in the original talk that's definitely worth watching for his full context. It's just that working on Fortnite has been leading Sweeney to think about how the underlying standards needed to build something that we'd think of as the Metaverse. He said it's not going to be owned or ruled by one company.

[10:15 PM] jin: lemme unpause AA ;P
[10:15 PM] SM Sith Lord: i had AA unpaused the whole meetup :smile:  Hubs is pretty light weight ftw
[10:15 PM] kentbye: I'm editing a batch of podcasts, but it sounded like a great meeting. I was able to pop in and out of it. Great job @Avaer, @jin, @ @chrisplatorres on moderating the discussion. Looking forward to when that Sweeney talk becomes available. I think I got a lot of the essence of what he was saying, but there's also so much more I missed. It's definitely a landmark talk in my mind, and one that'll continue to ripple for a while
[10:16 PM] Avaer: thanks Kent, really looking forward to hearing it in full
[10:17 PM] jin: @SM Sith Lord I don't see it

[11:18 PM] kentbye: FYI: Tim Sweeney retweeted one of my tweets tonight that was in the M3 thread, and he also liked a screenshot that I posted. I linked to the video of the meetup tonight, and so there's a greater than 0 chance that he'll take the time to watch the video of the meetup. That'd be super meta

Here's my tweet storm on @TimSweeneyEpic's talk.
Looking forward to when that video is posted online as it was an amazing talk with lots of details that I missed. It was super dense, and very forward-looking.
