# metaverse
  - everyone wants a unicorn
  - failures
  - hifi, altspace, steam, fortnite, twitter?
  - except it already exists, the web
  - so why doesn't it really exist?
# 2 pulls
  - towards invention
    - go off and make an awesome thing and tell everyone to come (second life)
  - towards standards
    - share the idealism and the things you'll build, then build nothing (blockchain)
# solution: meta verse
  - work on a higher abstraction layer
  - web innovation: ship the decoder with the data
  - let other people's content run on your thing
# middle way
  - da wae
  - build tools you use
  - standards: run other people's code, unmodified
