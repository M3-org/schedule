00:17
that's a dhobi atmosphere that was their
00:19
answer to here while they're like emra
00:21
oh that's good that's not enough though
00:24
they had this dopey atmosphere which was
00:25
very much like GML where people write
00:31
standard stuff but I don't I think they
00:35
might I had to plug in but everything to
00:36
plug in for that good YouTube used to
00:38
use plug inspected yeah it was the same
00:40
kind of man very very similar
00:42
I don't even know why it failed maybe I
00:46
don't know why maybe was just the wrong
00:48
time or something for it because it
00:49
seemed all right to me man
00:51
I mean it seems like why used it instead
00:53
of VRML don't you be like multi-species
00:56
but it was there dude I got the wiki
01:02
piece to that I'm wondering can I should
01:03
I respond the wiki page or is just an
01:05
image
01:09
[Music]
01:16
all right put it somewhere that's cool
01:24
yeah thumbs baa
01:31
sorry I don't have headphones nearby
01:35
okay the reason why is because there's a
01:37
bit of my own you can use the mute
01:44
button
01:45
where's next to the magic wand at the
01:49
top yeah I think he found it yeah just
01:54
make sure to do that though because
01:55
otherwise it's gonna be really
02:32
Julianne's of dollars from Google yeah
02:36
they get roebucks G bucks
02:46
[Music]
02:54
these invisible collisions Firefox
03:01
prevented that actually it works fine on
03:10
Chrome this is still not updated so you
03:20
just pushed it to the next to repo right
03:24
yep all right one sec I actually didn't
03:30
push it I've put up a pull request
03:32
oh yeah I see
03:58
[Music]
04:06
here let's try is this it
04:17
[Music]
04:20
av er yeah so look like this
05:06
nice so you got that link
06:28
the walkush of this place is so busted
06:34
like you never know where you can walk I
06:36
think the best way to navigate is the
06:39
slash fly mode okay so we're it's a time
06:52
to start you know like five minutes go
07:05
over everything I guess yeah there's a
07:07
few people who are here that we're here
07:10
lost meetup so do you yeah do you guys
07:15
have mics yep a gamma mic hey what's up
07:20
guys it's Teddy you know what's going
07:25
good here man good to hear
07:27
thanks for the invite Jin looking
07:30
forward that I actually watched the last
07:31
stream that you guys did really excited
07:34
for what you guys are doing flat beer
07:36
good to meet you pleasure to meet you as
07:40
well
07:47
somebody s IRL problems I hear things
07:51
breaking and Maidan made it yeah I'm
08:05
really echoey I'm sorry it's fine we
08:09
actually had that I last night as well I
08:15
love cuff buttons next time yeah it's
08:19
cool and even if you just want to type
08:21
or if that's easier than that works soon
08:28
okay this is becoming a mess already
08:32
yeah as long as it's all those long as
08:35
people aren't posting stuff near this
08:37
main section then it's it's all good no
08:39
I don't think so like cheese flecks
08:42
those huge because like now when we're
08:45
booting it's already like 30 items it's
08:47
just gonna get worse and worse as people
08:49
take more and more photos and yeah let's
08:52
go ahead
09:11
all right
09:38
okay um I'm ready yep let's go ahead and
09:43
start them sorry foxy here
10:00
okay I think the the we should go ahead
10:05
and take care of the things that came up
10:07
last meeting which are the best meeting
10:10
times and the ORD name let's go over why
10:13
we're having this again just to remind
10:15
maybe some people who are new here as
10:19
well yep so the purpose of this meetup
10:25
is for all the people who are working on
10:29
X our projects built on open foundations
10:33
and standards like the web itself to
10:36
have a place to share knowledge
10:42
information and build towards kind of a
10:45
more collaborative space where we can
10:49
like stand here actually we're kind of
10:52
deciding what we want to do here
10:54
compared to other efforts that have you
10:59
know Metaverse kind of groups in the
11:01
past so what the main purpose is to kind
11:04
of mm-hmm
11:05
how would you word it Chris so we want
11:09
to make sure that we have compatibility
11:12
across these different projects there's
11:14
a lot of great work that's being done
11:17
and it's it could be most beneficial
11:20
when we're able to be compatible and
11:24
share things between projects and not
11:26
have these separate silos that are doing
11:28
great things but aren't able to be used
11:33
in between these different projects yeah
11:37
so this group is all about
11:39
interoperability between all the
11:42
platforms and frameworks and I would say
11:47
that goes beyond not just the software
11:50
that we're using but hardware as well I
11:52
think a lot of us here believe that XR
11:55
is a cross organization cross software
11:58
cross headset cross platform type of
12:01
thing
12:02
and my personal take is there's so much
12:09
raw talent out there that is working in
12:12
silo's in doing really awesome stuff but
12:16
um we're not really talking to each
12:18
other quite enough in order to get the
12:21
most benefit out of the thing we
12:23
actually all kind of want to do which is
12:25
to build a matter verse whatever that
12:28
means to a lot of people yep so we're
12:35
looking at this from a full stack pretty
12:38
much and how to make all the pieces work
12:40
together um and that's what really I
12:42
think sets us apart from other efforts
12:47
in a past because nowadays we do have a
12:49
fully working stack but before like when
12:52
they did this in early 2000s and 90s it
12:54
was not all quite there or just
12:58
inaccessible we could actually think we
13:02
could start on games
13:03
I think the dreams have been happening
13:05
for quite a while but it's only just
13:08
recently where both the software and the
13:11
hardware is kind of coming online to the
13:13
point where it can actually be all
13:14
interoperable not only in terms of the
13:19
amount of content that's out there but
13:22
performance and the willingness of
13:24
people to actually collaborate and the
13:28
platform's becoming open enough and
13:30
distributed enough that we can all start
13:34
to glue things together sorry Chris I
13:37
cut you off no I'm just saying that
13:38
that's actually a topic that we have on
13:41
here and we could use that as the you
13:43
know warming up the group trying to find
13:46
out there are these past attempts out of
13:49
Metaverse and you can just go to
13:52
Wikipedia look up metaphors and then
13:54
you'll see that there's these groups of
13:56
people that organized and you know
13:59
either built a virtual world or worked
14:01
on standards and we're trying to figure
14:04
out why is our attempt going to be
14:07
useful likewise right now the right time
14:09
and like a viewer and Jen said there's
14:13
now a full stack and it's built on
14:19
it's built in such a way that it can be
14:24
it can be built upon the the current
14:27
technology of the web do you want to go
14:29
into more detail there in terms of full
14:32
stack some people might not be fully
14:35
familiar with what that means but just
14:37
full stack means the entire breadth of
14:41
Technology from the low level things
14:44
like the operating systems and the
14:46
hardware to the higher level things like
14:49
engines and content frameworks and
14:52
applications in the end it's really just
14:57
now that we've got all of that kind of
15:00
coming into play like for example maybe
15:02
you guys have heard of Atmos there's
15:04
these guys that are building like a
15:05
completely open headset that's based on
15:08
just basically 3d printed parts on just
15:12
standard parts that you can get from
15:13
Qualcomm and other companies that do
15:16
inside out tracking that do displays and
15:18
you could basically piece together one
15:20
of your piece together a headset that
15:24
works and does all the things without
15:26
really relying on some monolithic
15:29
corporation like Facebook to say okay
15:32
here's the headset and here's how you
15:34
can use it and on top of that on some of
15:36
us that exocad we've built an engine
15:38
that runs web content for headsets like
15:43
Atmos
15:44
and then you have the guys at a frame
15:46
and super medium who are basically
15:49
building frameworks on top of things
15:50
like that and then you have a whole
15:53
bunch of amazing content that's coming
15:55
out built on top of all these things and
15:57
all these things are open source and
15:59
anybody's for you to kind of pick them
16:02
up and run with them and there's tons of
16:04
experimentation going on right now
16:06
and there's really no hasn't been I feel
16:09
a good venue for all of us to get
16:11
together and to talk about the common
16:13
issues that were finding in
16:14
compatibility just ideas that we've had
16:18
and just find ways to share because
16:23
right now we there is things like the
16:25
WebEx our spec group for example but
16:27
that is very exclusive and basically
16:29
unless you're Google you don't have much
16:31
to say
16:32
so what happens there and then of course
16:34
you have partnerships with Qualcomm
16:36
which are all under NDA so it's really
16:39
hard to for us to kind of like talk to
16:43
each other when it's just through all
16:44
these corporate and closed channels and
16:47
we're kind of trying to undo a bit of
16:49
that with this group yeah I think
16:56
another big point to this and we can you
16:59
know we can actually have anyone who
17:01
wants to pitch in pitch in here there's
17:04
something that if you look at the past
17:07
attempts or conversations about the
17:10
Metaverse in general is there's a
17:12
pitfall of the concept being too
17:15
philosophical and not being grounded in
17:19
practical implementations of these
17:21
concepts of compatibility
17:25
interoperability and I think that's
17:28
something that this group should be
17:29
founded on which is how can we be
17:31
grounded in practical applications of
17:33
these concepts right um I think we can
17:38
all agree that this is face full of
17:40
dreamers there's a lot of people that
17:42
want the Metaverse exist to exist um and
17:45
probably a lot of us have wanted it to
17:48
exist since we were kids um since we
17:50
read things like Snow Crash or
17:52
what-have-you or maybe even more recent
17:54
additions to the family because we read
17:56
ready player one or saw the movie and
17:58
thought hey this is the kind of world
18:00
that I want to live in but yeah I think
18:06
with the most important thing if we're
18:08
gonna make the most out of this group is
18:10
to not let go of those dreams but kind
18:13
of ground them in reality and the skills
18:15
that we bring to the table and what can
18:17
we actually accomplish rather than
18:19
dreaming about the headsets that are
18:23
coming or the software that's coming and
18:25
just sitting around and waiting I think
18:27
we should have a bit of a bias towards
18:30
action and the things that we can do
18:31
because I think we've already proven
18:33
that we can do quite a lot together we
18:36
put our mind to it yeah there's enormous
18:40
talent in this space right now
18:43
and there's massive opportunity with
18:46
platforms that we have to be
18:48
interoperable and build something that's
18:51
greater than a sum of its parts and
18:55
hopefully that ends up being some kind
18:58
of meta versatile yeah
19:00
there's steps to it you know I think
19:04
with this group we can accelerate the
19:06
arrival there's something that Jen I
19:12
think Jen was the originator of this and
19:14
it's something that we can open up to
19:16
the group and see if people are
19:18
interested that so in terms of how can
19:23
we find ways that foster this community
19:27
of practical steps towards a Metaverse
19:32
one of the ideas is having some kind of
19:35
virtual hackathon where there's groups
19:37
that come together and try to build
19:40
something that's in this field of
19:43
compatibility or you know bringing these
19:48
different projects together in the
19:50
meadows yeah PACA Thon's game jams these
19:58
are kind of items on a plate that you
20:00
know can focus this group and future
20:03
meetups that we can you know you not
20:07
just share information but out of those
20:11
conversations and exchange of knowledge
20:14
we can build things and prototype things
20:17
that I think will glue together parts of
20:22
a Metaverse in a way that is gonna set
20:26
us apart from past efforts and also just
20:29
kind of paving the way like you'll see
20:32
from some of lightning talks that we
20:34
have today some people here are working
20:37
on really interesting but overlooked
20:40
parts to it I believe and so a lot of
20:44
this is kind of more grassroots
20:46
bottom-up approach like bringing
20:48
together the real Indies that are just
20:51
kind of you know running on passion
20:55
but also kind of principles of open and
20:59
decentralized Metaverse yeah I think the
21:05
we're kind of actually making it through
21:07
the topics here that in at any time if
21:11
anyone has any ideas feel free to pop in
21:14
there is a you know trying to stay
21:18
grounded for this group there's the
21:21
concept of having skin in the game and
21:25
what makes people encouraged to build
21:29
instead of philosophizing about the
21:32
Metaverse or using the you know this is
21:36
entertainment something like that I was
21:39
it's a fun if it's fun people are gonna
21:41
do it so maybe the entertainment is
21:43
something that could help keep people
21:46
motivated it's fun to build it's
21:50
actually a good point no that is a good
21:53
point on and certainly like as a maker
21:55
of something that's very obtuse in some
21:58
ways a very tech heavy kind of thing
22:01
which is just a browser engine it
22:04
certainly helped a lot to just put out
22:06
examples and just let people start using
22:09
the actual software and just having a
22:11
front-end that people can play with has
22:14
been really important because like that
22:15
actually allows the real technology to
22:19
kind of like connect with the brain and
22:20
generate fun so to speak so maybe like a
22:25
mini game that people could spawn into
22:27
these any space that they go to that
22:30
would instantly show them some kind of
22:32
fun
22:33
in the environment yeah dude you should
22:40
show some of the stuff that you do if
22:43
there's like away are you on Firefox Dan
22:51
mmm Firefox has the screen sharing but
22:55
you got twitch as well yeah this is why
22:59
we're here talking about compatibility
23:01
yeah because this this kind of minigame
23:04
would have to go into whatever the
23:05
platform is
23:07
whatever engines running I certainly
23:10
have thoughts on that in my talk today
23:14
sure just one example of incompatibility
23:18
I went on oculus browser and I went to a
23:23
games section and in the games there's
23:25
three games and I clicked one of them
23:28
and and then it brought me to a Facebook
23:30
sign-in screen oh dear
23:33
and I just thought you know this is a
23:35
great example just like the absolute
23:38
state of the web right now in terms of
23:40
VR and immersive yes do uh you guys
23:46
actually want to jump into the lightning
23:48
talks is there anything that any
23:51
comments on what we talked because this
23:53
is kind of you know I was talking a lot
23:58
but we want to make sure anyone
24:00
expresses their ideas I want to express
24:05
one thing real quick that guy looks like
24:07
bender that's I thought Jim had a cool
24:10
avatar but my god that dude takes the
24:11
cake now that's not bender don't you see
24:14
the goatee yeah oh it's flex oh my god
24:19
it's a mistake you can only make once
24:25
yes if there's a if no one has anything
24:28
to say what will open a the conversation
24:31
up again after the lightning talks but
24:33
for the lightning talks we have Avior
24:36
doing your presentation then Jen then
24:38
Seth and those will be about five
24:42
minutes each and really interesting
24:45
topics yeah exactly yeah just don't trip
24:52
over the robot
24:56
yeah so I just want to make I just want
24:58
to make a quick comment as a first timer
25:00
sure I really love what you guys have
25:03
going on here and there really shows the
25:07
possibilities of what we can do I mean
25:08
just everyone jumping in the same room
25:09
from all across the world with some
25:12
similar thoughts where you know where we
25:14
used to be bound by our geographical
25:17
locations and I was having a
25:19
conversation with someone like that the
25:21
other day you know you your your your
25:26
Wolfpack on the story or or your your
25:28
people around you your own you're always
25:29
limited by you know how far you can
25:31
drive but the ability for all of us to
25:33
be in our own locations right now and
25:35
and collaborate and I'd have to say you
25:39
guys have a real good foundation started
25:42
and with it with the interoperability in
25:45
ways to promote jumping from the
25:48
different spaces I just got into VR
25:50
about a year ago or so maybe less and
25:55
really excited to what you guys have
25:57
going on and I kind of see some of the
25:59
hurdles that you guys are talking about
26:00
and just really excited to be a part of
26:04
it and something that coming came into
26:06
mind when they were talking about games
26:10
almost like a goose hunt where you have
26:13
to jump from world's world on these
26:17
different platforms and in order to do
26:20
that of course we'll need that
26:21
interoperability but almost like a big
26:23
digital goose chase or something like
26:25
that I think would be fun and would be
26:28
able to get a lot of attention to it
26:30
that's awesome dude across the platform
26:33
cross game event
26:34
I haven't know if I've ever seen one of
26:36
those yeah exactly
26:37
that's kind of the wall we're trying to
26:42
get past right now but as you guys are
26:44
talking about you know things to start
26:46
establishing some of this foundation
26:47
that you guys are talking about with
26:49
interoperability between the different
26:50
platforms that that as a goal may be an
26:56
option I think that would make for an
27:01
excellent tech demo
27:07
great so if anyone else or if not then a
27:14
veer will start sure so let's see if I
27:25
can cut this down to five minutes
27:27
talking about the Metaverse after all so
27:30
basically the Metaverse everybody wants
27:33
the Metis it's kind of like this unicorn
27:34
everybody wants to catch and it's
27:37
something that's it's a concept that's
27:40
kind of littered with it's a graveyard
27:42
full of failures so you might agree some
27:46
of you might not agree with some of
27:47
these failures and I'm listening here
27:48
but like high fidelity
27:49
alt space VR chat steam fortnight or
27:55
even Twitter I consider all these kind
27:57
of platforms that wanted to be a bit of
28:01
like a mattress idea to kind of collect
28:03
everybody and collect all the world's
28:05
content and they kind of fell apart for
28:08
different reasons um and I think one of
28:11
the main reasons is that they all tried
28:13
to become a silo that owned all of the
28:15
data and I think that's kind of like
28:17
antimatter bursts to me it but to me I
28:21
would also say that the meta burst is
28:23
also a thing that already exists it's
28:24
called the web and we all access our
28:27
discord we all ask access our Instagram
28:29
or Twitter and sooner or later were even
28:33
gonna be accessing our games through the
28:34
web with things like Google stadia um so
28:37
I would say like in some sense the data
28:39
and all the access points or the
28:41
metaphors and for all of us to
28:42
collaborate already exists so then why
28:44
does the Metaverse not actually exist
28:47
and I would say that it's basically
28:49
these two different polls on that we
28:52
have going for us one of them is that
28:54
everybody's trying to be an innovator in
28:56
this space we're all trying to make
28:58
awesome things where there were a
28:59
corporation or an ad we're gonna make
29:01
something that has an impact and we feel
29:03
we can connect to but on the other hand
29:06
there's a whole bunch of other people
29:08
that are trying to make standards and
29:10
make platforms to build on top of things
29:13
like unity things like game engines
29:15
things like the browser specs and
29:16
they're not necessarily makers they want
29:19
to build platforms for
29:20
other people to use and these two aren't
29:23
really connecting like you have a whole
29:26
bunch of innovators making content and
29:28
then you have the engine makers who are
29:30
just making engines and then eventually
29:33
you all have to kind of choose your
29:34
feudal lord who do you connect to and
29:36
then we all end up in silos and we end
29:38
up fighting these senseless wars of
29:40
compatibility and we can't load things
29:42
because we're not using the correct
29:43
browser so my solution to this is that
29:47
we should actually have a Metaverse with
29:49
emphasis on the meta meaning that we
29:52
need to build architectures where you
29:54
can take content from anywhere and
29:57
Transplant it anywhere else and the way
30:00
that the web's has the web platform has
30:02
solved this is we basically ship the
30:04
decoders for our data in our actual data
30:08
when you ship a website you also ship
30:11
the frameworks that you're using along
30:13
with that website you can ship 3js you
30:15
can ship your models you can ship your a
30:17
frame you can ship your logic you
30:19
encapsulate that all until website and
30:21
you run in WebGL and webex are and to me
30:23
that is like the concept of a piece of
30:26
meta verse that you can transplant
30:29
across platforms it's kind of what we're
30:31
working on with XO kit which is just
30:34
basically a 3d browser where you drop in
30:36
a URL and the URL becomes a place a 3d
30:39
URL in a 3d place so yeah I would kind
30:45
of like emphasize that we should be
30:46
following this middle way where were
30:50
transplanted we're making content that
30:53
we want to use but we also make sure
30:55
that that content is built on some sort
30:57
of standard that you can all agree on
30:59
and we can transplant into other
31:01
people's content without necessarily
31:02
either of us having to talk to each
31:06
other very much other than agreeing on
31:08
what the standard means and that allows
31:11
for something called permissionless
31:12
innovation which means I don't need to
31:15
go ask you can I make something that's
31:18
compatible with your thing I just make
31:20
it on this standard and I say hey here
31:23
you can go load this in whatever
31:27
framework that you want to use and to me
31:29
the best candidate that we have for that
31:30
is the web because the web is the
31:33
Metaverse
31:34
it's just not quite there yet I'm pretty
31:39
sure some famous people once said that
31:41
the future is already here it's just not
31:43
evenly distributed and I think that's
31:46
where we are and where we should kind of
31:48
be headed
31:49
what's my talk whoo I don't know how
31:55
that comes through microphones so I
32:00
guess if sensing we could do question
32:03
and answering jewelry space they have
32:05
the little clapping emote okay I see the
32:08
stuff popping up in chat all right
32:09
that's like does anyone have any
32:11
questions for baby respawn a thing
32:30
hello hello
32:50
my talk is there we go
32:57
okay so my talk is about how do we
33:00
enable avatars and objects to move
33:02
between virtual worlds I do not have all
33:06
the answers but I am documenting the
33:12
many ways that attempts have been made
33:14
and sandboxes that are created to
33:16
prototype this question about so in this
33:22
screenshot right here this let me just
33:26
maximize it let's see how it looks in
33:30
here okay so the aspect ratio is a
33:35
little bit messed up
33:38
[Music]
33:46
[Music]
34:03
yeah I'll just do the whole screen oh I
34:14
messed up did anyone have any questions
34:19
for a beer after sock yeah we can do Q&A;
34:29
if there's any questions
34:37
okay Chris has just we see your chat
34:43
okay yeah where we can save them till
34:53
after that's fine too
35:02
so the question is I'm not sure if this
35:05
is really a question yet but it seems
35:06
like unity is the biggest force in this
35:07
space at this point I would say so in
35:11
some sense unity built a business model
35:14
around kind of cross-linking all of
35:17
these different platforms the main
35:18
problem with that that I see is that
35:20
it's controlled by a single entity at
35:24
this point a single for-profit entity
35:26
which is highly incentivized to do
35:28
whatever it can to make money rather
35:32
than actually serve what people want and
35:36
I'm not sure if there's anybody even
35:38
like the games industry or from
35:40
tangential industries like XR there's a
35:42
lot of politics that come into that that
35:45
just prevent Indies from actually doing
35:47
what they want
35:48
um to some extent unity allows you to do
35:51
that through plugging ecosystems but I
35:54
still think there is a lot of problems
35:56
with just having a single corporation
35:58
kind of control what you can and can't
36:00
do hey Chris yeah totally so yeah I'm I
36:06
think so far exo-k it seems like you
36:09
know I don't know just this thing kind
36:11
of descending from the have some
36:14
response to like not only how slow the
36:16
browser's are moving but also like I
36:18
don't know just potential performance
36:20
increases so kind of one-one depressing
36:23
thing for me as someone who's you know
36:25
kind of basically refuses to invest in
36:27
unity despite like being tempted every
36:29
single keynote or whatever and unreal
36:31
being like slightly more tempting
36:33
because it's like you know the source is
36:35
visible you know obviously though the
36:37
license is still commercial license blah
36:39
blah blah but I don't know like I'm
36:41
curious actually your personal sense of
36:43
the performance gap like you know how
36:46
far do you really think just like WebGL
36:50
to can be pushed and like custom ela
36:53
underneath you know I'm not really
36:54
trying to think about the web GPU kind
36:56
of stuff that's gonna come eventually
36:58
and just you know like the last thing
37:00
I'll say before I shut up is the
37:02
smartphone was the web just lagged so
37:04
hard right like like you couldn't make
37:07
snapchat you probably really still can't
37:09
make snapchat on a smartphone right like
37:11
you can't just the even the fact that
37:13
you can't have a false
37:13
you know experience with a web app you
37:17
know or just how Apple has every
37:19
incentive in the world to like you know
37:21
both kind of protect their users but
37:23
also not open the sort of native
37:25
performance and so I mean there's a part
37:27
of me that I'm all-in on the web but I
37:29
do have this kind of lingering like oh
37:31
god like does web GL 2 ever even like
37:34
you know can that ever meaningfully
37:37
compete with unity or like is there a
37:39
gonna you know and I could start talking
37:41
about Waze them and blah blah blah blah
37:42
but so anywho yeah I'm curious where
37:45
your sense it's sort of like the
37:47
potential performance gap or like if you
37:49
see that is an inhibition or yeah how
37:51
are you sure about all that so the
37:54
question is basically how do we solve
37:56
the performance problem on the web I
37:58
think a lot of the problem is that when
38:01
people say web they mean a very specific
38:04
thing they mean chrome and Chrome is in
38:07
many ways not necessarily incentivized
38:09
to really take any of these standards
38:11
seriously or at least to take them
38:13
seriously in a different direction which
38:15
is mainly to be quote unquote secure
38:18
which means nobody else can get access
38:20
to your data except Google Google is
38:23
very protective about that because
38:24
that's how their entire business model
38:26
works for selling ads if they don't
38:28
control the data then they can't make
38:30
money um so they have not focused at all
38:32
on performance like this is kind of a
38:34
side issue and if they can't get any
38:36
good PR out of it I don't think they
38:38
take it seriously which is why there's
38:39
so many thick coats of paint between the
38:43
actual code that you write and the GPU
38:44
hardware that you're using in something
38:47
like XO kit I kind of like realized that
38:50
this was happening because I was trying
38:52
to make a minecraft clone in JavaScript
38:54
and it was basically impossible because
38:56
I was running into performance issues
38:58
with the Dom with WebSockets with all
39:00
these things that have nothing to do
39:01
with what I was trying to accomplish but
39:03
they're in chrome and this is how chrome
39:05
works and I couldn't change anything
39:06
there so the way that I did things in
39:08
EXO kit is I just threw away all that
39:10
crap in basically the JavaScript calls
39:12
OpenGL directly and that means you get
39:15
essentially native performance on every
39:17
single platform and I don't think that
39:19
this is an inherent limitation of web
39:21
this is an limitation of the existing
39:26
implementations especially on
39:27
phones where you have not only Google
39:29
being incentives to take the web in a
39:32
certain direction but also Apple saying
39:34
no to Google and just kind of Acquia as
39:36
saying to what Google is doing so you
39:37
have this crazy power play that's
39:39
happening and I think still the web as
39:42
the technology has absolutely no
39:43
limitation here it's just the
39:45
implementations and we're trying to fix
39:46
that with exo-k by being directly native
39:49
and close to the hardware and as to
39:54
things like web GPU for example even
39:57
Chrome I think has plans to build their
40:01
WebGL implementation on top of Vulcan
40:03
and much more higher performance things
40:04
and we're planning on doing the same
40:06
thing with X ok so I think things are
40:09
only going to get better from here as
40:11
well hopefully that covered the main
40:16
points yeah yeah I mean I could keep
40:18
going but I don't want to take up a ton
40:19
of space and there's more don't you keep
40:21
talking about it throughout the night
40:22
but you know I'll pitch more later I
40:26
feel like other people maybe have
40:28
questions or other presentations and
40:29
stuff sure is there any other questions
40:32
no we can move on to gin yep and we'll
40:40
have a general discussion after the he
40:42
talks as well thanks Chris yep
41:03
[Music]
41:09
all right is this visible yes sir so my
41:22
talk is about moving avatars and objects
41:25
between virtual worlds and I am just
41:30
researching this documenting the various
41:35
prototypes done so in this prototype for
41:38
example It's Made in Janus and it's how
41:42
do we actually Traverse how do I like go
41:45
from here and hubs into a another world
41:49
that's made maybe in Babylon or a frame
41:52
or just like how do we actually walk
41:53
between different sites on build
41:57
immersive web where you know nowadays on
42:00
2d browsers we just open up a tab where
42:02
we click a link but in a 3d web we have
42:07
we can imagine new possibilities for
42:09
linking worlds and content together so I
42:13
think it happens on a sliding scale and
42:15
this was conceived of a VR blockchain
42:20
Alliance meetup when Ben Nolan from
42:23
crypto voxels and I were discussing like
42:27
how do we actually kind of rank these
42:29
implementations and so we got a sliding
42:32
scale level 1 is a simple hypothesis up
42:38
in you tab links we use them all the
42:40
time and in a 3d sight sense do you all
42:46
see this ok cool on this is what it
42:49
looks like in a typical Janus or an
42:52
a-frame representation where this
42:57
represents a link to another site and if
43:00
I click it it takes me into a new
43:03
website so interactive buttons links
43:08
they can be retexe shared with a
43:11
thumbnail
43:14
got another example here for an a-frame
43:18
this link will take you into HTML so
43:23
that's level one level two oh here's a
43:27
crypto voxels implementation so if I
43:31
wanted to go from crypto voxels into a
43:34
frame then it supports links for HTTP
43:43
Steam hi-fi and VR chat protocol
43:48
handlers and so if I wanted to open up a
43:52
frame I just clicked that sketchfab
43:55
Cimmerian unity and there's also
44:01
protocol handlers for VR Chad and
44:03
high-fidelity and this will actually is
44:06
launched it shouldn't have done that so
44:12
and the our chat they have basic portals
44:17
so when you spawn a portal into a site
44:22
you can just walk through it so instead
44:24
of clicking something it's just a it's
44:27
traversal through moving through
44:29
something and we have this
44:34
implementation in Janus as well now you
44:38
just close your chat okay so in Janus
44:42
we've got a component of which you can
44:45
retexture or anything in and when you
44:47
pass through it it takes you into
44:50
another site completely new URL and once
44:53
the site is actually loaded in your
44:55
cache its instance you can instantly
44:58
transport from one to another
45:00
vr site and this example came from 2017
45:08
when we have someone going through into
45:12
a a pram site from Janus and we can
45:15
actually see them through this web
45:17
surface on here so we see them go
45:20
through and appear on the other side
45:22
does that since arcade yes
45:26
because the windows and so this works
45:30
with any external URL and here's a
45:36
first-person view of that so if I want
45:39
to go from Janice to a frame I just go
45:42
through here it's like a doom style
45:44
transport I see my friend in there and
45:46
then I can traverse back into Janice and
45:49
complete the loop so this turns the
45:54
whole kind of immersive web into you
45:58
know a recursive experience I can show
46:03
you now level three is what Janice VR
46:06
currently has implemented and it's my
46:18
whole screen sharing now see it's
46:23
actually flipped
46:48
okay and then a level-3 implementation
46:53
once looks like this so if I want to go
47:05
to google.com I can open a portal and I
47:12
go from this website into another
47:16
website and this is seamless so I can
47:20
see another person who's here walk back
47:24
and so the level 3 implementations so
47:28
far Janice ER is the only one that has
47:31
this but the vision for Janice is to
47:37
seamlessly connect any type of
47:39
experience not just Janice sites but
47:43
like anything could come it'd be cool to
47:46
walk into a steam game like this for
47:49
example or a Minecraft world or whatever
47:52
have you just like turn the whole
47:54
Metaverse like have this kind of like as
47:56
a portal gun that you can just go into
47:59
anything but um yeah and next types of
48:04
implementations of this would just be
48:06
like making it more seamless how do we
48:10
actually you know and how do we bring
48:13
our avatars or our items with us so
48:15
setting up these kind of portal
48:17
sandboxes then sets up a good kind of
48:21
sandbox for prototyping how can we bring
48:23
avatars and objects if we even want to
48:26
have resistance of that between these
48:28
worlds I think it's a interesting field
48:32
of research and one of the things we've
48:35
got in Janus is you can drag and drop
48:38
links or into browser window as well and
48:44
so like how you spawn a portal and VR
48:47
Chet we want to be able to spawn a
48:49
portal in the browser that
48:52
takes you to any other site essentially
48:55
and it turns the whole internet into
48:58
like a vr MMO so that's my presentation
49:03
any questions I actually had a question
49:09
if I started off you were talking about
49:11
launching stuff with the protocols or
49:16
was I just showing stuff you're talking
49:20
about before earlier you were talking
49:23
about launching stuff like the custom
49:25
protocols from crypto voxels and stuff
49:27
like that like the steam protocol does
49:30
it work for any protocols because like
49:31
in a web browser any protocol that's
49:33
installed in the computer works so like
49:35
the origin protocol and in stores all
49:38
that stuff should work that way
49:41
manually allowed for steam - dr Chet you
49:46
are ice and that n HTTP of course so we
49:53
could add support and I know Janis web
49:56
has support for ipfs and Det but not
49:59
many browsers have that implemented
50:02
without needing kind of like a
50:03
third-party extension or going through a
50:08
gateway well I think that the like the
50:13
steam protocols like that - right you
50:15
need to have it and installed on the
50:16
system for the browser to even tell you
50:19
that it can be handled so it's really
50:22
exciting how you're able to bridge
50:23
things together with those protocols I
50:25
mean that's those protocols seem
50:28
powerful yeah yeah I mean you know goals
50:39
I guess we would have in the long term
50:41
is essentially like an overlay that you
50:44
know you could attach it work a lot like
50:46
Pluto VR I guess where you have like a
50:50
program on your computer or something or
50:53
maybe attached to your browser and what
50:55
it would do is essentially relay like
50:57
the three-dimensional data or like the
50:59
server data or your position in space or
51:02
whatever kind of like how mumbles
51:04
position audio work
51:06
where you know you could shoot an
51:08
overlay like a portal onto a surface of
51:12
an object and walk through that into
51:15
another entire game universe or
51:17
something like that like that's
51:19
something that is in theory probable and
51:22
you know definitely doable yeah I think
51:26
it even for standalone programs you
51:28
could open it in the another window or
51:30
something in the background why wouldn't
51:32
you be able just yeah with like Vulkan
51:35
API and stuff like you can pretty easily
51:37
get like you know the normal direction
51:41
of a certain face in the world right
51:43
like like of a poly basically just
51:47
attached like a like an overlaid thing
51:50
that sort of just bridges the gap
51:52
between like the program the 2d program
51:55
a 3d VR program and the actual like an
52:00
entirely new kind of way and be like
52:02
httpd but across three-dimensional space
52:06
so it's all seamless anyway I think this
52:11
was also brought up has another question
52:13
Jun what would you say to the notion
52:17
that there's there could be another
52:19
layer beyond this on third tier which is
52:23
not necessarily portals but everything
52:25
being a URL even objects even avatars
52:29
even places as well just being URLs that
52:34
you can load and composite into your
52:36
world basically like reality layers or
52:40
reality tags you know portals
52:52
essentially just like a stencil light
52:54
shader essentially that blocks out you
52:57
know you guys know what a stencil is you
53:01
get that right so it's a stencil thing
53:04
and it doesn't actually have to be a
53:07
portal or something like that it could
53:09
be anything it could be an object piece
53:11
of text an image whatever like always
53:14
you just remove the stencil and then
53:16
it's you know it's in the world so that
53:17
it's not fertilized I guess
53:19
you can pause it with a depth buffer
53:22
exactly yeah we've basically been doing
53:25
a lot of experimentation with that not
53:27
only necessarily doing things across
53:29
some websites but also with things like
53:32
steamvr as long as you can get access to
53:34
the frame and the depth buffer and you
53:37
can get this at a reasonable frame rate
53:39
I think it's entirely possible to
53:42
actually composite things that were
53:44
never intended to work together ordinate
53:46
or not even necessarily things that are
53:48
running on the same machine but you have
53:50
enough bandwidth you could theoretically
53:51
just do a 3d stream of it as well yeah I
53:55
mean with some of the api's from Vulcan
53:57
and stuff like that I mean no it's not
54:00
even really that hard of a frame hit to
54:03
sort of become some of this stuff
54:04
especially up here you know if you're
54:06
optimizing for it but yeah you know link
54:09
seems be represented in different ways
54:11
like what Sith Lord has with his front
54:15
end one of the layers of the links that
54:18
I was showing like with level 1 that
54:20
could be extended down to where instead
54:23
of a link represented just kind of as a
54:25
text object um it can be represented as
54:28
a 3d object and you can traverse by
54:31
interacting with some kind of object in
54:33
the world leave a charge of the screen
54:35
like the beachings in mario 64
54:37
yeah the way yeah the way I see this
54:39
working in the long term is essentially
54:41
like a get in a post sort of function
54:43
that you see on like a browser you know
54:46
and but instead of working just in the
54:48
browser on that rendering pipeline it
54:50
would work across like you know your
54:52
entire GPU architecture so that you can
54:55
like get in post any content from
54:58
anywhere has its own sort of object
55:02
format that just overlaid on the screen
55:05
in the same way that like your avatars
55:06
are all just overlaid on this scene
55:08
right now you know the frame buffer
55:10
saying that you're ahead of whatever's
55:12
behind you and Saturday we could just
55:14
you know basically do that from a
55:19
rendering like a normal browser style
55:21
rendering perspective my thoughts
55:22
exactly
55:23
um this is why kind of leagues yeah go
55:27
ahead sir Chris oh yeah yeah so this is
55:31
a thing I can't tell if this is a genius
55:32
idea or
55:33
saying idea but I don't know if you all
55:35
have noticed how the Mozilla folks have
55:37
used gltf extensions as a way to
55:40
annotate objects with components but
55:43
there's in the hub's chat so I started
55:47
trying to talk to the team there a bit
55:49
about how something like scripting could
55:51
work in an environment like this one of
55:53
my personal interests is thinking about
55:55
how to teach code like wow I'm in VR in
55:59
the environment I'm in right means of
56:01
scripting but of course that opens all
56:03
sorts of like crazy security problems
56:05
potentially depending on you know who
56:07
you invite to said chat or you know
56:09
there are other kinds of security models
56:10
like if you know the people you're
56:12
inviting but anyway yeah it'll also then
56:15
got me thinking about you know in their
56:17
case they're just kind of like say
56:18
naming components that are attached to
56:20
GL TFS but like with something like
56:22
wasum or even just you know JavaScript
56:25
it's like a weight is gltf HTML and then
56:27
like you could basically like have an
56:30
extension that would be the kind of
56:31
JavaScript or could you add behavior or
56:33
you know kind of mini programs or like
56:36
you know if you're talking about
56:37
different portal Styles like maybe even
56:39
like different shaders that get attached
56:41
to a given link but and one more thing
56:44
to kind of toss in here that I'm curious
56:46
if you all have thought about like so in
56:48
a web browser for example obviously like
56:50
you know are any mainstream one the top
56:53
bar is like a sacred region right like
56:55
you can trust that that hasn't been you
56:58
know like painted by some adversary
57:00
right but in this case of like Metaverse
57:02
links and jump portals like how do you
57:05
really know where you're going and maybe
57:07
implicit is just like oh it's just GL
57:09
tf's and avatars like there's no scripts
57:11
and stuff but I think scripts is like a
57:13
really juicy thing that I haven't heard
57:15
a lot of people thinking about like how
57:17
one could organize that safely or you
57:19
know um yeah one of the components that
57:24
Janus has is you got a navigation part
57:29
of the UI and you can always bring them
57:32
as he's sewing
57:34
see I can always bring up that dress bar
57:38
right good question but yeah I've got I
57:42
can I can traverse any site here with
57:45
this UI address bar and I can always
57:50
bring up an address bar here from
57:52
anymore ha ha so some of these
57:55
discussions and like WebEx are spec
57:58
space the way that Google has
58:01
interpreted this is that security is
58:04
basically impossible with navigation
58:06
so they're basically banning it on that
58:09
basis so the base is basically being
58:15
that anybody could spoof this URL bar
58:17
like once you take control of the users
58:19
vision um it's kind of like a
58:22
free-for-all for spoofing you eyes and
58:24
you can't really trust anything I
58:26
actually don't know what the solution to
58:28
that is but some of the ones that have
58:29
been proposed are where there's some
58:31
sort of trusted UI such as the UI knows
58:34
things that only the UI could know such
58:36
as maybe there's an icon or it's your
58:38
face and it's securely presented such
58:41
that the site would never know and some
58:44
other ideas in AR that we had was there
58:47
could be like a piece of dedicated
58:49
hardware maybe you look on your wrist
58:51
maybe on your watch where if you look at
58:52
it I see that it's not spoof a ball and
58:55
then you can tell oh I'm actually at
58:57
this URL no matter what my eyes are
58:59
telling me I'm actually a hockey world
59:00
but I think fundamentally it's just that
59:03
Trust has to start somewhere and we have
59:04
to decide where that is and who we trust
59:07
and what the root and the tree of trust
59:10
is
59:15
is scripting something that you all have
59:17
I mean in that same kind of wheelhouse
59:19
it's like that ^ like more evil and
59:22
insanity right but like so when you talk
59:24
about the Metaverse and you're talking
59:26
about links it sounds so far mostly like
59:28
avatar avatars and sort and like 3d
59:30
models but if you thought about like a
59:33
domain for for scripting or behavior or
59:35
like how one would approach that I mean
59:38
it's the same kind of security problem
59:39
right but the way we've the way we
59:42
approach that at X Oak it is everything
59:44
is completely isolated we don't run
59:47
scripts in the same context they're
59:49
entirely separate rendering context I
59:51
cannot interact the only way you mean or
59:55
what yeah the only way that things can
59:58
leak is by user input and user
60:02
engagement but that is a very real
60:04
problem with each other and it's
60:09
entirely possible for a user to have
60:11
reality layers that none of the other
60:14
layers know about that still does not
60:17
solve the security problem though
60:18
because right you can infer behavior of
60:21
the user as to like what they're doing
60:23
let's see how to virtual keyboard and
60:25
some of these entering a password
60:26
somewhere by virtue of knowing what the
60:29
user is doing with their hands you could
60:31
infer what their password was so there
60:33
is by no means like is this all problem
60:37
so this is some stuff like that exact
60:39
example you brought up is something that
60:41
we have like really thought about with
60:43
Janus so one of the things we did is
60:45
essentially just add at the client level
60:48
if you have your box over an input box
60:53
right you literally just stop rendering
60:56
it stop sending any data of hand
60:58
positions or anything like that to to
61:02
the multiplayer server that way you know
61:03
and this is very similar to how it
61:06
actually works on a normal and browser
61:08
right like on certain input boxes
61:10
there's no way that that any that the
61:13
any other scripts can see what that info
61:16
input box what you're actually typing
61:18
into it and that's all defined by
61:22
standards I mean I think that's the
61:23
biggest issues essentially we just need
61:25
to define
61:27
as an example gltf as like a rendering
61:29
standard certain multiplayer protocols
61:33
as a standard so that you know so
61:35
there's a unified API that we can all
61:38
essentially use and that the browser's
61:41
can know that this is how the data is
61:44
going to come in so that it can
61:45
implement like rational security
61:48
protocols for a lot of this stuff and
61:49
that without standards I mean there's no
61:52
way that they can do this for every
61:55
single potential use case right now for
61:57
the multiplayer side coached where you
62:04
know no one's using VR stuff for banking
62:07
for serious things yet so there are like
62:10
we've we've taken approach we want to
62:12
see what's possible before we really
62:15
lock everything down so we do have
62:17
support for scripts they all kind of run
62:19
in the same context you know potentially
62:22
if someone wanted to abuse that they
62:24
could except for the fact that there's
62:27
you know no one really doing anything
62:28
that requires that little security kind
62:31
of using Janus and so one thing we
62:34
looked at it is kind of I think a mode
62:36
where you could run where it would be a
62:37
little block down so you know maybe a
62:40
certain client would be that kind of
62:43
more free-for-all and you kind of you
62:45
know every once in a while might run
62:47
into something but if you're running
62:49
something where it is you know you want
62:51
to keep it locked down that would be an
62:53
option that you gotta have in the client
62:56
right I think where it gets I think
63:00
where it gets especially interesting as
63:02
well is where we have a notion of
63:05
defining a piece of content in the space
63:08
or in some sort of volume and if we can
63:11
securely block it so that it's only
63:13
rendered within that volume and inputs
63:15
are only tracked within that volume and
63:17
I think that could be another possible
63:20
solution to the input problem if you
63:26
want to kind of look at a interesting
63:29
another example at the OS level ok cubes
63:34
OS cubes queue you
63:37
yes they have an interesting
63:41
architecture where everything is sandbox
63:44
separately so you can open up sketchy
63:46
attachments and it's not gonna affect
63:48
the rest of your system and it's super
63:55
high security OS I think that's kind of
63:58
where the ideal future for me lies like
64:02
everything's kind of sandbox and you can
64:04
do whatever you want within that sandbox
64:06
and it's the job of some sort of OS
64:09
layer or a user agent or something else
64:11
to make sure that these boundaries
64:12
aren't leaked
64:13
I think the browser has actually done an
64:16
excellent job here and I think it's also
64:18
just much too restrictive at this point
64:20
the cross-origin type things
64:23
in acts are right now our screen scripts
64:31
all run in the same context the kind of
64:33
main context for the renderer but if you
64:36
run those were in a worker thread right
64:38
you can kind of keep those sandbox but
64:41
then you have to provide like a kind of
64:43
bridge API we're kind of sinking the
64:45
script State with the the world's to
64:48
render state you know right yep very
64:52
similar to the architecture that we
64:54
landed up with X okay sorry I actually I
65:06
know the reality tabs are you know I
65:10
literally using the iframe sandbox or is
65:13
it a web worker or is it blossom or like
65:16
where are you getting the security
65:17
context right is that a question for X
65:20
okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
65:23
it's basically it's basically just
65:26
iframes it's literally you have an
65:28
iframe API and then the iframe loads an
65:30
entirely separate context and the way
65:34
that these are composited is they're
65:35
composited by the user agent on the X
65:38
our session you have a layers array and
65:40
you just stack a bunch of iframes into
65:42
that layers array and it's the job of
65:44
the engine to composite all that but
65:46
these iframes do not know about each
65:48
other unless they choose to know about
65:50
each other by posting
65:51
between yep all right cool sit you ready
65:56
I am ready as long as you don't hear our
66:00
phone ringing in the background fifth
66:04
Lord he is here to preach the holy
66:08
gospel of shortcuts and my god I have
66:11
learned a lot from him about shortcuts
66:13
and at a deeper level of the meta verse
66:16
which is not just attached to web
66:19
browsers but I want to you take it away
66:21
so shortcut okay
66:23
first can we remove this black screen
66:25
back here my little one that sees this
66:26
you are the only one okay so I'm here to
66:37
talk about shortcuts I've had arms we
66:41
had hands I'd asked like raise your hand
66:42
if you use the shortcut to get here
66:44
today checks is all right you did you
66:46
either clicked on in a link in discord
66:47
or something or it was a bookmark in
66:49
your address bar I actually did that
66:51
right I got here or you launched hey
66:53
look at that we got hands I you can have
66:56
a desktop shortcut all kinds of stuff
66:58
right the Metaverse I heard somebody say
67:00
earlier the meta verse is kind of like
67:01
the the web the web was like kind of
67:03
like universe it's just not visualize
67:05
the right kind of way it's 2d when I
67:07
think of the meta versus I think of
67:09
existing web and computers in all the
67:13
technology step it into the third
67:16
dimension so all the 2d stuff I think is
67:20
gonna have there's gonna come with us
67:22
into the 3d stuff and that's where
67:23
shortcuts come into it so we already
67:26
know even if you're here in VR you came
67:27
here launching a shortcut that's how we
67:30
get around currently in the metaphors
67:33
everything's built around shortcuts we
67:35
use them all the time on our phones in
67:37
our browsers on our desktops inside a
67:39
steam all that kind of good stuff so
67:43
what is the shortcut that's what I'm
67:45
going to talk about today shortcuts are
67:47
the most important part of the shortcut
67:49
is the the file target it's the address
67:51
it's where you're going right if it's a
67:53
link it's just like a HTTP address it's
67:56
all that you need to get there but
67:59
that's cool that makes it functional but
68:02
what makes it look nice so if
68:05
a GPS coordinate right if you have a GPS
68:07
coordinate you can get there but what's
68:09
there you don't know what it is so to
68:11
make a link a shortcut a destination you
68:14
know like an address look nice we put a
68:16
meta tags on it metadata so on that GPS
68:19
coordinates if you put a title tag on
68:21
there and say like Los Angeles
68:22
California then you're not looking at
68:24
some abstract numbers you're looking at
68:27
Los Angeles California on a map or you
68:30
know that it's gonna be on Memphis
68:31
that's LA right then if you put some
68:33
more tags on there such as an icon or a
68:36
screenshot or something like that you
68:38
got a good representation there so when
68:40
you look at your desktop I'm hoping that
68:41
after today you know every time you look
68:43
at a shortcut you think it you look at
68:45
it differently you see differently
68:46
because you look at your desktop that's
68:48
what you're seeing you're seeing
68:49
shortcuts to specific things and then
68:54
they have these extra meta tags to make
68:56
them have a rich presence in the world
68:59
so um here's some examples of shortcuts
69:05
we use I'm gonna actually move the sword
69:11
now actually I don't want this one yet I
69:14
don't want this one yet I'm actually
69:15
delete that one I'm gonna start with one
69:17
I actually came prepared today I'm gonna
69:20
grab this image and spawn it in here
69:32
make a giant all right
69:41
now bigger giant skyscraper that yeah
69:59
okay so assume just pretend that you
70:02
love the city okay so here's city
70:05
skylines you usually see it as like a
70:08
desktop shortcut depending on how you
70:09
regularly watch your favorite game
70:11
skylines maybe you watch it from steam
70:13
and you see it like it looks over here
70:15
in your Steam library browser or maybe
70:19
you see it you launch it from the store
70:21
page right so what I'm saying is
70:22
shortcuts not only do they take you to
70:24
the place they kind of are the rich
70:26
presence for the destination it's not
70:29
just a GPS court it's just Los Angeles
70:31
California
70:32
the place where dreams are made right so
70:34
the how we represent shortcuts in the 3d
70:38
Metaverse has to be awesome because it's
70:42
it's alright on our desktops right okay
70:44
we're shortcuts better than that and
70:46
discord they're way better if you put a
70:48
link into discord you get a good rich
70:50
presents for it you get the title
70:51
attached to it the description of the of
70:54
it you get a screenshot of it sometimes
70:55
the video plays right there
70:57
so representing shortcuts Oh inside the
71:01
meta verse is gonna be huge because
71:02
shortcuts have been there part of the
71:04
better versus the very beginnings dawn
71:06
of the computer age and people are
71:08
always gonna have their favorite stuff
71:09
and they're always gonna want to get
71:11
there so that's they're always gonna
71:14
have shortcuts they're not gonna go away
71:15
so I talked about the simple ones down
71:18
here now what's up with the 3d ones well
71:20
that's stepping it into the the VR room
71:23
the 3d room right so we have the
71:26
metadata the metadata that we were
71:28
working with on these shortcuts is the
71:30
same metadata we see down here these
71:31
other representations especially right
71:34
here on the store page just kind of just
71:35
displays it all wait we could take that
71:37
same metadata that describes City
71:42
skylines and represent it however we
71:43
want in our front ends and here's some
71:45
examples of it it can be just a icon
71:48
sitting in space that's the most boring
71:50
way or you could make you
71:53
since it's a game sake you know a
71:54
physical object you sit in or stand in
71:56
front of over here it looks obviously is
71:58
like it's a computer stand and this is
72:00
just the same shortcut represented in
72:02
different ways and that's huge so let's
72:09
look this is some 3d representations in
72:11
our soldiers house team represents it
72:12
let's talk about some other examples
72:13
briefly about how people and how
72:16
companies successful companies currently
72:18
represent things like games and movies
72:22
TV shows or even actors and stuff like
72:25
that on their their platforms so let's
72:30
talk about Netflix sure we've all use
72:32
Netflix would you browsing Netflix it
72:35
has these kinds of representations for
72:38
all of those it has the the mark Hamid's
72:41
right there I'm sorting through the list
72:43
and it has the title it even has a
72:45
preview video our DVRs do this steamvr
72:50
does this on this same kind of level
72:53
that you're seeing in these pictures
72:54
steamvr home oculus home you spawn your
72:58
shortcuts as 3d objects now would you
73:03
would you look at these screenshots gin
73:09
if you could please Scott spawn one of
73:11
the screenshots that has a bunch of my
73:13
stuff in it because I'm gonna talk about
73:14
how I love all of it oh yeah let me just
73:17
get one of those so when you see a
73:21
screenshot it might look like a bunch of
73:23
random stuff but the person whose stuff
73:26
it is they recognize it all so I'll put
73:29
it this way if fun if I showed you my
73:31
desktop full of icons it would just look
73:34
like madness to just a bunch of crap but
73:36
if you saw your desktop you would
73:38
recognize it all your bike hey those are
73:39
my my the games that I love up on the
73:41
top left and those are those awesome
73:43
website bookmarks over there on the
73:44
bottom right it has this personal
73:46
connection to you so yes they're
73:48
shortcuts I got to make a huge a tiny
73:51
they're shortcuts but to the people that
73:55
created them these shortcuts are
73:59
basically their representations of what
74:02
the metaphors is this is their sliver of
74:04
the Metaverse this is all that matters
74:06
you used to see what matters to you and
74:08
your bookmarks and your favorites by
74:09
looking at your desktop and seeing how
74:11
you organize your favorite icons or your
74:13
favorites menu and steam or origin or
74:15
open it up your favorite bookmarks bar
74:17
that how all the good stuff in it that's
74:19
how we used to visualize our favorite
74:21
stuff because the Metaverse is built
74:23
around shortcuts to stuff so if we just
74:25
visualize those exact same shortcuts in
74:28
another way it has that same personal
74:32
value to us the people that create it
74:35
but it just takes it into the next
74:37
dimension here so the moral of the story
74:41
is would you look at shortcuts
74:43
you gotta envision how they would look
74:45
in different platforms if you if you
74:49
took the shortcut that you that you
74:50
actually launched to get to something if
74:52
you took it and you put it into the 3d
74:54
world
74:54
what would your shortcut look like now
74:57
turning it into a portal like we said
74:59
earlier jumping into the screen or
75:01
something to actually transition into
75:03
the other game that's awesome let's get
75:05
there
75:06
but before we get there currently we're
75:09
already at shortcuts so I say let's make
75:12
the shortcuts look good and then we'll
75:15
start working our way up from the level
75:17
one on the last chart we'll start while
75:18
working our way up to the vendor
75:19
transitions oh to wrap it up I'm also
75:22
going to just explain what you're seeing
75:24
back here because I did not explain that
75:25
first of all I probably should have led
75:28
with this how's everybody doing
75:29
I'm Syd Laura I'm the programmer of what
75:31
you're seeing right here this is anarchy
75:32
arcane it's a 3d desktop it's it's just
75:35
about specializing shortcuts customizing
75:38
them and launching them that's what it
75:42
is so yeah I hope you all look at
75:45
shortcuts y'all you just every shortcut
75:47
that you see your vision how you would
75:49
put it in your 3d VR room and with that
75:53
I'm gonna open it up to questions thank
76:01
you for those little clap icons are you
76:06
familiar with like Open Graph and rdfa
76:09
and kind of the web effort to kind of
76:13
provide these type of kind of
76:15
descriptions for content
76:18
okay so you are talking about
76:21
descriptions for the shortcuts so like
76:22
an a database of icons for example like
76:26
it's it's kind of more like like you
76:28
mentioned on discord if you drop a URL
76:30
and you know sometimes it can pull up
76:32
the video preview or sometimes like the
76:34
image preview things like that basically
76:38
that it's kind of like inverting the
76:39
concept of the spork cut where as
76:43
content like if I publish a website I
76:45
can put those tags in my page that kind
76:48
of call out that this page represent
76:51
this URL represents a video and here's
76:55
like here's a URL to the thumbnail of it
76:58
here's a description of it here's you
77:01
know the title things like that you can
77:04
put in your corporation really good
77:25
api's that may not be open api's but
77:28
informatively open you can access them
77:31
information back to me so that's always
77:33
good too but the thing is the web
77:35
doesn't always have those so would you
77:37
go or into a website believe it or not
77:39
Netflix doesn't adhere the meta tag
77:41
standards so when you're going to these
77:42
websites you would expect them to you
77:44
would be nice if they all follow the
77:46
standards but the reality is that they
77:49
don't be to follow once right okay Jim
77:56
if you could actually demonstrates what
78:02
we're talking about here that was my
78:04
question was not like are you aware that
78:06
this exists is more like yeah but like
78:14
that's the easy case but yes absolutely
78:16
if they have the information right there
78:18
on the meta tags that's wonderful now I
78:20
will all say one thing about the minitek
78:21
standards before I describe these two
78:23
images here um they're great but they're
78:25
not up to par if you look at things like
78:28
Netflix Hulu and these media rich
78:31
websites they have more than one image
78:34
per atom per entry in the database and
78:39
they and they also have a preview video
78:41
associated with it so you can see a
78:43
trailer before you go access the full
78:45
version of the media so while the
78:47
standards are great it seems looking at
78:50
like Hulu and Netflix and stuff that
78:52
they're falling behind I do agree to
78:54
because when I try to represent
78:55
shortcuts in a 3d space if you only give
78:58
me one image what am I gonna do
79:00
I could put it on a tablet that's it so
79:02
you and even in a 2d environment like
79:05
like obviously on Netflix and Hulu and
79:06
stuff and you need to have more than
79:08
just the one image to really give it a
79:09
media rich presence there and that's
79:13
what these extra fields are throwing in
79:15
there to do but the metastatic standards
79:17
are a great foundation and as I'm about
79:19
to explain right now that's the
79:20
foundation of these so if you look at
79:22
this one on the top there it's the
79:32
website Vimeo and from the website Vimeo
79:35
there's a plug-in this is what how
79:38
Anarchy Arcade works this program over
79:40
here now the shortcuts are awesome
79:41
everybody should be doing shortcuts now
79:42
I'm talking about mostly about inner
79:43
cure and how it works it uses the meta
79:46
tags to scrape off of that website and
79:48
it fills out the forms in this the
79:51
shortcut properties here so like you
79:53
just like to do look at your properties
79:54
of a desktop shortcut you got your
79:55
properties there and then with the
79:57
properties that's all that you need to
79:59
give it these representations like all
80:01
the different own cities cities skylines
80:02
representations and because it works
80:05
mostly off of meta tag stands you go
80:08
over here to other sites like the steam
80:09
store over here do the same thing you're
80:12
just filling out this meta you just
80:14
filling out your shortcut properties you
80:17
can do it manually or you can do with
80:18
your meta tags you can Duke the official
80:20
api's but in the end sometimes it takes
80:24
a little elbow grease or or scrapers or
80:27
something like that to really get it in
80:29
there
80:34
it would be great to see the kind of
80:36
stuff that Netflix and all those places
80:38
use get adopted into the the website
80:41
meta standards meta tag standards it
80:43
would make my job a hell of a lot easier
80:44
because I could just pull everything
80:45
from the page make everybody's job
80:48
easier and it seems to be the way things
80:50
are going I don't know maybe the meta
80:52
tags were made back to the past before
80:54
they wanted to have two images of the
80:55
video well there is I mean for the open
80:59
Open Graph is the one that most people
81:01
use basically Facebook's not really
81:03
standard there is like a mailing list
81:07
where people will discuss that stuff but
81:09
uh yeah I think a lot of them were
81:10
basically defined back in like I think
81:13
when that launch was like 2009 and like
81:15
that and they kind of defined a whole
81:18
bunch of them and kind of then stopped
81:21
yeah yeah you see the the concept of
81:25
riders marching forward what are the
81:27
standards it let's catch up how would
81:32
how do you think is the best way that we
81:35
can incentivize companies with a lot of
81:39
this rigid data to implement something
81:42
that's very conducive to the meta tag
81:45
standard what can we do to incentivize
81:48
them so to get them to adopt the same
81:53
kind of fields that to make our job
81:56
easier so that we don't have to rely on
81:58
something like scrapers for anything
82:00
well I think they already do it they do
82:05
it privately so obviously I mean you can
82:07
look at those sites and see that
82:09
internally they have this meta
82:10
information bound to each item but we
82:12
were talking about publicly putting it
82:14
out there for the good of openness oh
82:17
well they make more money when it's not
82:30
I mean the way that Facebook like
82:33
Facebook and Google have done this by
82:35
basically holding sites for ransom if
82:37
you don't implement those G tags if you
82:38
don't implement kind of uh you know tags
82:41
for can make your site crawler friendly
82:44
if you don't write your site in amp you
82:46
know you're not gonna get good placement
82:47
on the search engines you're not gonna
82:49
get the nice little pretties exactly
82:52
yeah
82:53
they have power over companies they've
82:58
convinced a lot of people to implement
82:59
those work on it kind of all of us are
83:02
coming from place where and we want
83:04
people to implement those to be open to
83:06
be friendly so that people can get at
83:08
the content but as you said that's not
83:10
always what they want but also that's
83:13
that's just for the scraping that users
83:16
often manually fine-tune their shortcuts
83:20
because remember everything you see the
83:23
skip over here I love I've seen all
83:24
those movies I've played all those games
83:26
I've customized them to be just the way
83:29
that I want so the the stuff that you
83:31
give in the default shortcut the default
83:35
icon if you will just think of like if
83:36
all your icons were default icons that's
83:38
just a starting point you can
83:39
automatically replace it with better
83:41
icons but in many cases users are gonna
83:44
watch that that custom I mean very often
83:47
they're gonna want that customization to
83:48
do what
83:50
what are you when you link in your in
83:52
your VR sorry what is energy in Anarchy
83:54
Arcade if you have a shortcut it's
83:56
linking to web media or I mean so are
83:59
you like scraping are you like let's say
84:01
you know right now in hubs for example
84:03
if I post a youtube link it gives me the
84:05
YouTube video but it's also assumes that
84:07
I don't want all of the rest of the
84:08
content in the page right like so if
84:11
you're talking about Netflix
84:13
I mean first off is there an API for
84:15
Netflix such that you could just like
84:17
get there like I don't think you can
84:20
decouple like watching a video on
84:21
Netflix from their page or their app at
84:23
this point right cutting tip okay so
84:27
let's talk about Netflix would you watch
84:30
a movie on Netflix in your web browser
84:31
you got that address in your web browser
84:33
you could actually bookmark that you
84:35
could drag that onto your bookmark bar
84:36
and
84:37
got yourself shortcuts to the web can
84:41
you embed the video at you but that's to
84:42
a page like or so so sorry and you're in
84:45
anarchy arcade I assume then you're
84:47
loading a full web browser and you're
84:48
looking at a whole Netflix web page so
84:51
when you're talking about what's being
84:53
displayed on the screens we're talking
84:55
about in game previews because anarchy
84:57
is much like your home or oculus home or
85:00
your regular desktop shortcuts these are
85:01
things that launch stuff up okay so if
85:05
we're talking about a shortcut to a
85:07
Netflix movie well first of all you'd be
85:09
able to launch it and it would open in
85:10
whatever your systems default browser is
85:12
but let's talk about what students get
85:14
shown on the in-game preview on the
85:16
in-game screen because we're not gonna
85:18
launch standalone Netflix app we're
85:20
gonna watch Netflix on the wall would
85:22
you watch Netflix it's full screen so
85:24
when you're saying to decouple it from
85:26
the full screen viewer the first guess
85:30
is it's loading the full screen video
85:32
stream on the web tab but the that's a
85:36
good thing but on the YouTube one okay I
85:40
think I got the YouTube question would
85:42
you spawn to youtube you're in anarchy
85:44
arcade you're not just spawning websites
85:47
because you're spawning the shortcut to
85:50
YouTube it's not showing youtube.com or
85:53
whatever website it is instead yeah
85:56
showing the representation of it it
85:58
could be representation as a tablet
85:59
where's an arcade cabinet but it is
86:01
definitely using the API in that case
86:03
and like I was saying earlier if you can
86:05
use the official API you use the
86:07
official API that's real good if it's in
86:09
the meta tags that's great too
86:11
the scrapers are only for bridging the
86:14
gaps so that people don't have to
86:16
manually customer ID I think part of my
86:20
what I'm pointing to is like this thing
86:22
ever did it sorry if a VR how do I say
86:26
your name actually a view a view yeah
86:30
you wrote like ages ago or like last
86:32
year you wrote you know why is it seven
86:36
years later or whatever and I still just
86:37
can't get a web page in in WebGL or
86:41
whatever right like I think some of what
86:42
I'm talking about is speaking to that
86:44
problem like you know if you're talking
86:46
about say 2d web content right like
86:49
which some of the stuff you're talking
86:50
about like
86:51
me a shortcut depending on what I guess
86:53
so you so if anarchy arcade is an open
86:56
platform then you yourself in that like
86:59
native app that someone installs and
87:01
like you know like on their their system
87:03
then can open a you could load a you
87:06
know chromium inside of that or right
87:09
like you can you can load a full browser
87:11
if you want it right but I my brain is
87:13
constantly thinking about this context
87:14
I'm in right now which is I'm in like
87:16
Firefox right I'm in Firefox nightly and
87:18
they're still no like dumb to texture or
87:21
whatever you want to call it right like
87:22
so shortcuts so then you're talking
87:25
about incentives for shortcuts it's like
87:26
well the incentives there's no
87:29
infrastructure to even look at to the
87:31
web content in a 3d web page and then
87:33
eventually the shortcuts would be
87:35
whoever said like Open Graph 3d it would
87:37
be like probably whatever Google Kali
87:39
has right now right like metadata toward
87:41
3d objects like sketchpads that right am
87:43
i okay you're talking about not being
87:46
able to display webpages in the 3d world
87:50
in a standard browser right at the
87:53
moment right they're still where you
88:01
give people pixel axis so quickly I'll
88:03
talk about that security hole right
88:05
there which is huge
88:06
for WebGL I've tried to make a Enter key
88:08
okay and WebGL I got really far but this
88:10
is the wall that I hit sure you can't
88:13
you can't render a web tab regularly
88:16
like a full web tab you can't render it
88:17
on there what when you get pixel access
88:19
because hackers are gonna steal the
88:21
pixels and stream it somewhere it's
88:24
still somebody stuff right so that I
88:26
don't think I know a little bit about
88:29
this in the spec groups first of all
88:31
this is partly being addressed but I
88:34
think the issue isn't necessarily pixel
88:37
stealing the problem that they have is
88:40
that the browser one has cookies two has
88:44
cross domain issues and three has
88:46
capture issues where if the user has a
88:49
cursor looking at a 2d page and this 2d
88:52
page could be something like your bank
88:54
account of course and by clicking on the
88:58
page you could deduce what the person's
89:00
bank account number what their credit
89:01
card is what their password is god
89:03
forbid
89:04
that is the problem that is pretty much
89:07
preventing the browsers from
89:08
implementing danke sorry it's not you
89:17
can't let somebody read certain stuff
89:19
and paint it to something that you could
89:21
read pixel data operate because oh they
89:25
so they are actually solving some of
89:27
this in the spec on the last that I
89:29
heard is that as long as you follow
89:32
cross-origin rules then you will be able
89:34
to composite yes that's already not yet
89:41
but as far as I know nobody's
89:43
implemented that but um that will work
89:45
but secondly you will not be able to
89:47
access the actual pixels directly this
89:50
will just be composite by the user-agent
89:52
specified with the transform audio
89:59
context analyzer just the other day and
90:01
I assume it's for the same reason
90:02
because you can open up and like a data
90:04
file password file or something and
90:06
analyze it like it's pixels or like it's
90:08
audio so yeah so to address that when
90:13
you currently if you open if you let a
90:16
full web tab render at any game surface
90:18
you got a security hole because if you
90:21
have scripting support if do you allow
90:23
per pixel access to the surface somehow
90:26
they're gonna do that so how here's an
90:29
eclair Kade's way to not even touch that
90:31
with a ten-foot pole so you guys are
90:33
talking about doing some serious stuff
90:35
you're talking about like logic that
90:37
crosses bounds and a cure kate isn't
90:39
like that and a cure arcade is like a
90:41
desktop it launches shortcuts just like
90:43
steamvr home oculus VR home whatever
90:47
spell lock this home so would you want
90:48
something it's there's no connection
90:52
right
90:52
so what anarchy arcane isn't a scripting
90:56
platform the people that create these
90:59
arcades they are only defining
91:01
properties they're not defining logic
91:03
and there's actually no scripting
91:04
platform at all and it other than what
91:06
just runs on the in-game screen that's
91:07
isolated from everything else so that's
91:10
how I hear acade circumvents that
91:12
problem but that isn't definitely a real
91:14
problem but yeah arcade you can post
91:16
everly just spawn for websites on the
91:17
wall
91:17
you can write on the way that we're
91:21
tackling this issue in execute is um we
91:24
are allowing all this stuff but I think
91:27
fundamentally what this needs
91:29
what this leads to is the users just
91:31
need to kind of understand the security
91:33
impacts of what they're doing the web
91:36
has 25 years essentially of training
91:38
users what the green icon means this URL
91:42
bar that's always secure I think we need
91:44
similar solutions for VR that don't
91:46
currently exist but I think the best way
91:48
to actually arrive at that point is to
91:50
experiment and to start early teaching
91:53
people correct browsing habits in the
91:56
next hour space I did something that
91:59
actually main anarchy arcade is like a
92:01
scriptlet that would appear in a web
92:04
browser cross-domain
92:05
I had to deal with so much costume aid
92:07
stuff I had to set up HTTP on my server
92:10
but after I did it it worked perfectly I
92:12
was able to write it to the right my
92:14
pixels in the canvas it's loaded as a
92:17
texture display it so it's awesome it's
92:20
definitely getting there and I hope that
92:22
one day we could do it because that was
92:24
the biggest wall for me man when I tried
92:25
to make Anarchy arcade web version I
92:27
just hit that wall and it seemed like
92:29
that was gonna be a major issue it's
92:31
nice to see that other people also yeah
92:35
I think this would be an interesting
92:37
topic to have or talks about or that
92:43
this I won't rant about course right now
92:52
that's cool can you guys hear me yep yep
92:56
all right cool um so yeah that was
92:59
awesome man that the Anarchy arcade is
93:02
so cool so you have to use you have to
93:06
basically for each so each thing that
93:09
they let let's say a end user right
93:13
wants to get some content right so you
93:15
have to specifically you can't rely on
93:18
the on the meta tag so you have to kind
93:21
of like set up each kind of main website
93:24
like let's say Netflix or YouTube you
93:26
kind of have to scrape it and figure out
93:28
what the what the data that you're gonna
93:30
want
93:31
Matt and then custom-build kind of each
93:34
made your website right right each one
93:41
hardly know ya know yukl each website
93:44
has to be custom Li implemented so you
93:46
gotta it's not like a standard like you
93:48
say like Open Graph or whatever so
93:50
there's not enough data there right
93:54
because how could we possibly write Java
93:57
scripts waivers for every site existence
94:00
that's right and tasks and that's one of
94:03
the reasons why I came here is because I
94:04
wanted to touch base on that stuff and
94:06
there really is no solution because like
94:09
let's say like you you guys are talking
94:10
about Netflix specifically YouTube is
94:13
that they won't open up their API
94:15
because they want to also show you like
94:17
let's say you have a Netflix membership
94:19
right you could sign in through your
94:21
through your browser not even go to the
94:23
Netflix website right like it's like a
94:25
Facebook account or whatever the idea
94:28
though is they all want I guess the big
94:31
corpse you know I mean once you want go
94:34
to view the content that you want to
94:35
view they don't want to just show you
94:37
the content itself they want to show you
94:39
their reference representation of the
94:42
content so they want to show you
94:44
basically you know ad on the right or
94:47
you know what's featured what's next
94:50
similar interests but if they you're in
94:52
your VR world you don't want to see
94:54
similar interest and you just want the
94:56
content and that's why those extra rich
94:58
those extra rich stuff is not their
95:02
problems like Netflix using through the
95:06
website they'll only serve you up to
95:09
I think 720p they're like the you know
95:15
wide buying DRM content plugins things
95:19
like that so basically it's the DRM
95:22
because of DRM they aren't gonna serve
95:24
you off the full four right right back
95:28
in the day it was Silverlight and they
95:30
switched to yeah
95:31
why'd violent others get me an extension
95:35
I don't know if they switched over that
95:36
yet or not yeah big drama about like
95:39
fire browsers getting that
95:43
yeah I'm thinking I wouldn't want to
95:50
watch if I'm trying to get like the
95:52
maximum quality experience in Netflix I
95:54
launched the shortcut so while some
95:56
things they could discord rich presence
95:58
previews again right some things the
96:00
rich presence is so the rich presence of
96:02
the shortcut is so good that you watch
96:03
it right there in the browser but
96:05
sometimes we click on the links to
96:06
access the full resolution image full
96:09
resolution video stuff like that so we I
96:12
don't think that the stuff we run on
96:14
embedded screens especially 2d screens
96:17
like this or is ever gonna replace
96:20
standalone apps we need to always think
96:23
of them as rich presences within the
96:25
world so on that note a couple more
96:28
things Netflix the side of Anarchy
96:30
arcade all the internal screens are 720p
96:32
because in practice all the screens seem
96:34
to be a little bit away from you not
96:37
taking up all the screen space anyways
96:38
so the internal screws are 720p by
96:40
default and if you want higher than that
96:42
you launch the shortcut and it opens and
96:43
whatever you're natively handling the
96:45
shortcut is if you have your VR browser
96:48
set up to consume it when shortcuts like
96:50
the at launched it would go into there
96:52
because everybody's different everybody
96:53
has their their own favorite apps okay
96:56
and and going back to the related videos
96:58
that you mentioned sometimes you would
97:01
want to see the related videos because
97:03
an eclair kata actually has an option
97:05
for this things like YouTube give you
97:08
the power and the API because like I
97:11
said use the API as if it's there to
97:13
specify all these kind of things whether
97:20
you want the related videos to be shown
97:22
or not so an anarchy okay there's
97:24
actually a mini where the user specifies
97:25
if they want what they want to happen
97:27
with the related videos and one of the
97:29
options besides just showing the regular
97:30
rated videos is for being the videos
97:33
that do a playlist so it's just you
97:35
click on one YouTube video for example
97:37
this works really good for you too
97:38
because it has an API and then that's
97:40
like a starting point for hours of other
97:42
videos related to that also when you're
97:45
loading the full website you're doing
97:47
what the company wants would you go to
97:50
the website you load the full website
97:51
you're making them happy Anna care Keith
97:54
doesn't have an ad blocker it's just
97:56
web browser right so would you go when
97:58
you make a bookmark to Netflix and then
98:01
you go to Netflix did you spend four
98:03
hours watch Netflix they're not mad
98:05
they're happy unless you adblock them
98:07
then they're pissed but yeah it's it's
98:10
it's not leeching at all it's just
98:13
consuming in the 3d environment there's
98:22
a lot to think about there thanks to the
98:24
Lord actually in terms of just logistics
98:28
when we have lightning talks can we
98:30
endeavor to keep them more close to the
98:34
lightning talk yes so the Lord's talk
98:40
was I think very sorry yeah I think it's
98:43
the questions that so I think we should
98:47
go ahead and recap the topics that are
98:50
still unresolved from last week which
98:52
are the org the official organization
98:55
name the meeting times that are best for
98:58
everyone and then how frequent we should
99:01
have these meetings so if you guys in
99:05
terms of organization name I don't think
99:07
that the original OMG open matter versus
99:11
gathering was controversial I think all
99:13
the other ones had some objections but
99:15
that one did not so that would be my
99:18
vote I think the github wasn't it
99:21
Metaverse makers meetup I suggested that
99:27
one and it's got more votes but at the
99:30
same time people are gonna be like what
99:34
it was it makers Metaverse meet you know
99:37
Metaverse make the or did they're gonna
99:41
mangle words meetup is also like this
99:46
huge corporation that everybody uses to
99:48
set up meetups and we don't want that in
99:51
confused with what we're doing here
100:01
would it be better if it was mm so oMG
100:17
works for me but we could call it m3
100:25
instead of yeah we can stick with mmm
100:33
but we can call it M 3 and C 4 flatly I
100:36
just like the idea www upside down
100:39
that's pretty sweet that was the first
100:44
thing I noticed when I saw those
100:45
suggestions do it I like it what they
100:51
say
100:52
my vote is did you say M 3 is like the
100:55
shorthand for it you know my diverse
100:59
Metaverse makers meeting or meet up I'm
101:04
fine with M 3 I'm rather than actually
101:06
having a stand for anything I think just
101:09
M 3 is a good name that's kind of cool
101:11
yeah we don't even like if you turn the
101:14
M even on the side it's like a tree
101:28
meeting times M 3 as the ORD name
101:31
organization name yep yeah could we get
101:35
that name on github you wonder if it's
101:38
even available I mean we can because the
101:44
official organ can be something else but
101:46
then the display name can be m3
101:55
there is someone who has the username m3
101:58
but they have like you know one
102:00
repository they haven't posted anything
102:02
in a while I don't know what github does
102:04
for reclaiming a counselor things like
102:07
better if I actually ask I actually
102:09
asked them before and they do have a
102:12
policy of like just somebody's not using
102:14
their account and they're not are you
102:15
gonna paying customer and you can kick
102:17
them out or we would have to just figure
102:19
out they really want to expose people
102:23
right yeah there actually is a guy that
102:27
has in theory but it's not being used we
102:31
could contact github but I also don't
102:33
think it matters too much we could call
102:35
it like n3 org or 23 something an
102:38
through group okay so okay um
102:42
logistically there's also meeting times
102:45
yep and I know there was some people in
102:48
Europe um wanted to do it more morning
102:51
in the States in North America I don't
102:54
have a strong opinion either way yeah
102:58
the reason for that is just so we can
103:00
include as many people as possible I
103:03
mean where we choose there's gonna be
103:06
you know if people in Asia want to
103:08
interview you know there's gonna be
103:10
somebody yeah I think actually 6 p.m.
103:17
PST which is what we've been doing is
103:21
accessible enough to two people other
103:24
than of course Europe is gonna be the
103:27
morning well here and there we can do so
103:32
like for Europe they would essentially
103:36
anyone who's on Pacific would have to be
103:38
here at 9:00 a.m. so maybe that would be
103:42
a once a month thing okay that's the
103:46
second topic which is how frequent
103:49
should these be and why you know what
103:52
tempo would make sense I think every two
103:57
weeks is been okay okay okay so
104:02
bi-weekly is as well be kept
104:06
yeah and I guess we'll update people
104:11
ahead of time on next time because this
104:14
was a little bit a shorter notice yep
104:18
but we're gonna define more roles like
104:22
timer slash moderator describe those are
104:26
the two most important roles I think and
104:28
Chris does a good job with the video
104:30
recording bed a scribe can use later on
104:32
after afterwards but you know just so we
104:36
kind of have some notes keep this thing
104:38
progressing does anyone actually want to
104:41
volunteer as a scribe for going back on
104:44
the livestream and uh you know are like
104:47
summarizing what we've talked about
104:52
coming out I can do it I guess I'm good
104:56
at that kind of stuff so okay good
105:00
appreciate yep yeah um also I think it'd
105:06
be awesome to have diversity and like
105:09
the people that are giving talks so I
105:11
mean if anybody here or who's watching
105:14
the vaad on YouTube has some that they
105:17
think would be of interest to the group
105:20
by all means we'd love to have you
105:23
propose a quick five minute talk and
105:24
then do a Q&A; especially if it's stuff
105:26
that you're working on I'm sure there's
105:30
a very receptive audience that would
105:32
love to see and hear your thoughts on
105:34
meta versity ideas yeah I
105:37
let's open something on our open
105:40
something on github where anyone who
105:42
wants to talk and propose a talk and or
105:46
refer anyone that they think would be a
105:49
good person to give a lightning talk
105:54
also as a couple im3 also another github
106:01
thing is will open up a founding values
106:04
I don't know like Constitution may not
106:08
be the right word for it but what
106:10
everyone thinks should be the founding
106:12
values of the group and what's important
106:14
to focus on
106:15
I agree and we can upvote and you know
106:21
see where people people's interests are
106:27
what do you what do you think we should
106:29
plan for the next one because we did
106:31
lightning talks this round what should
106:33
the next one be we could have a
106:35
discussion I think Lightning talks are
106:39
like as long as they're contained enough
106:42
and like we keep to the five minutes and
106:45
we do break out sessions afterwards for
106:47
a long Q&A; I think we could have
106:48
lightning talks every single time like
106:51
just probably enough talk
106:52
enough topics that people want to talk
106:54
about that we could just set up 15
106:57
minutes of every meeting to do that but
106:59
also the panel discussion thing is
107:00
interesting to me I don't know what we'd
107:02
be talking about there but pretty pretty
107:15
fast
107:15
[Music]
107:23
five minutes talk in 15 minutes
107:27
QA my recommendation at a space with the
107:30
microphone where people could walk up to
107:32
when they ask their questions we got the
107:36
snack table already you've got to take
107:37
it up a notch with the meta sure anyone
107:42
who has a github who is just post on the
107:45
organization and everyone will be added
107:48
as members so people can make new
107:51
repositories open you know PR issues and
107:55
all that
108:08
and well and people are bringing up all
108:12
these examples of m3 but you know I like
108:14
the meaningless of it definitely nothing
108:19
unique so what kind of gives us a cloud
108:23
of mystery and who should we try to
108:28
contact get up about the m3 name
108:31
specifically or come up with a round
108:34
about m3 name for the work kind of hurt
108:37
task there get up as pretty responsive
108:40
and I know that they do have a policy
108:42
regarding this okay is it but if you're
108:46
kind of like established organisation or
108:49
is it just like no I think on the way
108:52
that they do it is if your account has
108:54
like not been used for like one or two
108:56
years and you don't have any commits
108:57
then like they consider you a squatter
109:00
or something
109:06
Chris asked why not use em three org
109:10
versus kickin that guy from m3 m3 seems
109:28
promising
109:29
based on the this guy hasn't committed
109:31
since 2014 also isn't the most
109:48
interesting m3 that I know about is
109:50
isn't that the workshop that the
109:52
Mythbusters used to work out of oh okay
110:02
so I think we should you know from here
110:06
to two weeks from now breakout
110:08
conversations to github and you know
110:12
work these these things out there and
110:17
there's a proposals RPGs and taken if
110:21
that's cool I don't know if it is it's
110:28
not an credo so nevermind
110:49
all right we're gonna move the naming
110:51
proposal back down to the github issue
110:54
and for next week we'll have a few more
110:58
lightning talks and I think we can start
111:01
organizing panels the next time after
111:04
cuz oculus quests are gonna be shipping
111:06
in I think we're gonna have a lot of
111:09
quality time trying those out before the
111:13
you know the one right after the next
111:14
one like a lightning talk or whatever
111:21
but just like a news recap of what
111:23
happened during the last two weeks it's
111:25
kind of interesting to you know to the
111:29
Metaverse as a whole just the artists we
111:36
can do it who wants to volunteer as the
111:38
news
111:40
newscaster um I say just opening it up
111:43
every week and just have people submit
111:44
like different you know they want
111:48
I would love to volunteer as I'm
111:51
somebody who's actually going through
111:52
the news or at least running down it as
111:55
a newscaster I am terrible at actually
111:57
keeping track of news though so as long
112:00
as there's a list then I'd be glad to
112:02
host that okay are these like when we do
112:06
these meetups and people drag bunt
112:08
images are these saved or this if I'm
112:11
wrong they're up there yeah they can
112:15
save a deer that'd be okay yeah so if
112:23
you pin them then we can come back and
112:26
see it but I'm not gonna in every single
112:29
image here by
112:35
it comes to the point there is also
112:36
baking it into the map so we can save
112:40
you know specific things
112:52
yeah or just take screenshots while
112:54
we're here and can remain REM there some
112:57
of those thanks for everyone for coming
113:01
and we'll do this again two weeks from
113:04
now
113:06
yep
113:07
see you guys on get up cool yeah cool
113:11
thanks GG m3
