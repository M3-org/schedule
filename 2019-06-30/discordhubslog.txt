[10:23 PM] BOTjin: Wow
[10:23 PM] BOTjin: huge names
[10:23 PM] BOTnn: but also just collecting eyeballs
[10:23 PM] BOTnn: hes saying bring stuff together and people will visit the exhibitors
[10:24 PM] BOTnn: why are we starting with the expo idea rather than a goal
[10:25 PM] BOTnn: just make a website with a list of links?
[10:25 PM] BOTjin: goals: sponsorships, awareness, scalable infrastructure, gltf booths we can re-use can be useful for other things
[10:25 PM] BOTnn: thanks jin
[10:25 PM] BOTjin: I could make a model template we build in
[10:25 PM] BOTjin: each person gets a 2x3 meter space to build in
[10:26 PM] BOTjin: in whatever program: blender, spoke, etc
[10:26 PM] BOTjin: glb export
[10:26 PM] BOTnn: this medium is limitless immersive computation. it just doesnt make sense to replicate convention center expos
[10:27 PM] BOTnn: who are these people who LOVE expos?!
[10:27 PM] BOTnn: expos are the cheesiest corporate social gathering i can imagine
[10:27 PM] BOTchrisnovello: expophile
[10:27 PM] BOTchrisnovello: EXPO KIT
[10:27 PM] BOTnn: XD
[10:27 PM] BOTnn: but its a reusable dead fish
[10:28 PM] BOTnn: no one cares about 3d models
[10:28 PM] BOTnn: no one is waiting for a medium to explore 3d models
[10:28 PM] BOTnn: its called thingiverse
[10:28 PM] BOTchrisnovello: fire fest burners
[10:28 PM] BOTnn: have a party.. going the 6th time
[10:28 PM] BOTSM Sith Lord: woo hoo
[10:28 PM] BOTchrisnovello: Sidequest Party Up
[10:28 PM] BOTkwadroke: let people see what's being worked on
[10:29 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: ;)
[10:29 PM] BOTnn: whats being worked on is not 3d models its dynamic computation
[10:29 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: virtual expo
[10:29 PM] BOTnn: hubs is the demo, not a 3d model of a hubs chat at a given moment
[10:30 PM] BOTnn: i think we need to put this expo idea aside for a minute to be able to think clearly about a good format
[10:30 PM] BOTkwadroke: 2m x 2m
[10:31 PM] BOTkwadroke: or so
[10:31 PM] BOTnn: you do realize its ridiculous to limit people to a physical space in a meidum that contains infinite horizons
[10:31 PM] BOTchrisnovello: constraint is fine
[10:31 PM] BOTnn: not 2m squared
[10:31 PM] BOTnn: that doesnt make sense
[10:31 PM] BOTjin: expos are neutral infrastructure
[10:32 PM] BOTnn: im just saying this is not an event i would attend
[10:32 PM] BOTkwadroke: we do have resource limitations, especially Tris
[10:32 PM] BOTchrisnovello: (no such thing as neutral infrastructure)
[10:32 PM] BOTnn: why are we not trying to expand the space of answers to the questoins posed by the goals, rather than just sticking to this one controversial expo idea
[10:32 PM] BOTkwadroke: others may have ideas on making money
[10:32 PM] BOTnn: what ELSE could we do
[10:32 PM] BOTkwadroke: from outside the group
[10:33 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: what will you show us avaer?
[10:33 PM] BOTchrisnovello: I personally dont want to build xr expos exactly but I do think you could do that, maybe even today in hubs
[10:33 PM] BOTchrisnovello: I think you become a promoter / organizer
[10:33 PM] BOTnn: science fair
[10:33 PM] BOTkwadroke: "no one can be told was the matrix is"
[10:34 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: you have to experience it for yourself
[10:34 PM] BOTnn: us
[10:35 PM] BOTnn: we are the audience
[10:35 PM] BOTjin: an open spatial computing platform
[10:36 PM] BOTkwadroke: other VR developers
[10:36 PM] BOTnn: so were saying what if we organized a conference
[10:36 PM] BOTnn: not really related to generating money more about community building / cohesion
[10:37 PM] BOTnn: no that is the problem lol
[10:37 PM] BOTnn: the problem is a lack of compelling experiences, isnt it
[10:38 PM] BOTchrisplatorres: Look at the sign what does it say?
[10:38 PM] BOTnn: true
[10:38 PM] BOTnn: lol
[10:38 PM] BOTnn: a girl entered the chat

[10:41 PM] BOTkwadroke: you hit F5 to refresh, if needed
[10:41 PM] BOTnn: F10 for cheats
[10:42 PM] BOTalfredo: i think that what's hard to see is that webxr is more cohesive with the idea of culture than native applications
[10:42 PM] BOTnn: yep
[10:42 PM] BOTkwadroke: sometimes it's not about the money
[10:42 PM] BOTalfredo: i have some stuff i'd like to showcase another day

[10:43 PM] BOTnn: yep
[10:43 PM] BOTSM Sith Lord: aayyye

[10:43 PM] BOTnn: airpods
[10:43 PM] BOTnn: apple watch
[10:43 PM] BOTnn: apple tv
[10:43 PM] BOTalfredo: specially if instead of thinking about making VR fit IN the web
[10:43 PM] BOTalfredo: extend the web to mean more things
[10:44 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: not having any apps on a phone is like not having a phone these days
[10:44 PM] BOTnn: notifications, background processes, camera stuff, etc
[10:44 PM] BOTalfredo: the problem is the view of browsers as viewers
[10:44 PM] BOTkwadroke: cause they want an icon on people's home screen
[10:45 PM] BOTnn: if they dont have a winning xr platform they may push web until they do
[10:46 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: it's culminating to something.
[10:46 PM] BOTnn: more things like hubs
[10:46 PM] BOTNoah_A_S: yeah
